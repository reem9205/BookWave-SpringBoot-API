## About

This backend service, developed using *Spring Boot, automates the management of library resources, including tracking books, managing user activities, and sending borrowing notifications. The system simplifies the borrowing and returning process, reduces errors, and enhances user experience by sending timely notifications about due dates, overdue items, and new arrivals. Using a *[specific database]** for data storage, it allows library staff to manage the catalog efficiently while improving communication with users. This solution reduces administrative burdens and enhances resource accessibility, meeting the growing demand for digital library management.
